Accessing information of medicines via QR Code

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
In today's fast-paced world, patients often struggle to access critical information on their tablet sheets, such as manufacturing details, side effects, and instructions for use. Traditional medicine tablet sheets are often cluttered and have limited space on tablet sheet, which results in condensed, small-font text that may be difficult to read, especially for individuals with visual impairments. The information is only provided in a single language, making it difficult for non-native speakers  to understand.</p> 

<h2>Scope</h2>
   This project aims to solve these challenges by embedding QR codes on each tablet byte in a medicine sheet, providing instant, multilingual access to clear and comprehensive medication information in a website.
